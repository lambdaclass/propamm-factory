/// The quotes a market may be in for a pair quoted in `quote`, besides `quote` itself:
/// for a USDC or USDT pair, the other of the two and USD, since the busiest market an
/// exchange has for a dollar pair is often in one of the others (Coinbase's ETH-USDC is
/// delisted; ETH-USD is where it trades). Nothing for any other quote. The lookup picks a
/// market by this, and the startup cross-check accepts one by it, so the two agree.
