//! The metric registry and the label-pre-bound handles every recording site uses.
//!
//! IO-free on purpose, exactly like `breaker.rs`: no sockets, no clock, no logging. The
//! listener lives in `exporter.rs`. That split is what lets every recording rule be
//! asserted against a throwaway `Registry` in a unit test, with no tokio and no network.
//!
//! Labels are bound once, at construction, never at the call site. A recording site holds
//! the child metric itself, so it costs one atomic increment rather than a hashmap lookup
//! and a `Vec<&str>` allocation — on a loop that requotes every 50ms, across every pair and
//! builder. It also makes a mislabelled series unrepresentable, which is the same reason
//! the pair label is derived from an on-chain `symbol()` call rather than configured.
//!
//! Every family here has a non-test caller: `pusher::run` constructs the registry and wires
//! the `/metrics` listener, and the feed, publish gate, RPC/landing, builder and node-push
//! call sites record into it. That matters for `cargo clippy --all-targets`, which treats an
//! unreached `pub` item here as an error the same way it would a private one (this module is
//! private to the crate, so `pub` signals no downstream consumer) — so an item added ahead of
//! its consumer needs a `#[allow(dead_code)]` naming the caller that is coming, removed once
//! that caller lands.
