//! The composite: one pair's `(delta, mid)`, averaged by weight over the venues it reads,
//! recomputed whenever any of them delivers, and judged by the pair's circuit breaker and
//! recorded into its σ history here, because these must see the number the lane
//! publishes, not any one venue's.
//!
//! A venue whose latest sample is older than [`MAX_PRICE_AGE`] drops out of the average
//! and its weight is spread over the rest; the pair keeps publishing as long as at least
//! `min_sources` venues are fresh, and stops (by publishing nothing, so the last composite
//! ages out downstream exactly like a stalled feed did) when fewer are. A single venue
//! with weight 1 is exactly the feed the pusher had before venues were plural.
