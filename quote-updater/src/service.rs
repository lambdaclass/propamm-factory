///   panel still draws it, and a registered 0 there reads as a key with nothing left. +Inf
///   is "never recorded", which that panel renders as ∞.
/// - `feed_up`/`feed_last_tick`/`feed_sample_current` are set only inside
///   `feed::spawn_feed`, which a `Static`-source pair never spawns — a supported
///   configuration (see pairs.example.toml), not an edge case. Left at 0 they would
///   permanently fire `PusherFeedDown`, `PusherFeedStale` and `PusherFeedSampleNotCurrent`
///   on a pair that is working exactly as configured. NaN fails every comparison those rules
///   make, including `time() - NaN > 30`.
/// - `signer_balance_wei` rides with the runway: same recording site, same cadence, same
///   never-recorded-until-then. NaN, and it now carries the weight the runway's +Inf used to.
///   `PusherSignerNearlyDry` is a `predict_linear` over this series, and one NaN sample
///   anywhere in its window makes the whole range return nothing — so a pair stalled on an
///   RPC outage cannot page an operator to top up a key that is fine. That suppression is
///   why this write is not a cosmetic one. It also keeps the "Signer balance" panel honest,
///   which divides it by 1e18 and draws it: a registered 0 there reads as an empty key,
///   where NaN draws a gap.
/// - `breaker_armed` says whether the pair is guarded at all, so a pair with no breaker is
///   visibly unguarded rather than absent and indistinguishable from one that has not
///   sampled yet.
///
/// A feed pair's `feed_up` is asserted here too, and it is true by construction: `build_live`
/// does not return until the feed has delivered a sample. If the socket has dropped in the
/// meantime the feed's own loop corrects it within RECONNECT_DELAY — worth that, because the
/// alternative is a re-armed lane inheriting the NaN its halted predecessor left behind and
/// never writing `feed_up` again until it happens to redial.
///
/// Everything else the feed writes while it is not yet the owner is accounted for here or
/// deliberately not. Every *gauge* it writes is seeded: `feed_last_tick`,
/// `feed_sample_current`, `feed_mid` and `feed_delta` from the sample below, and
/// `breaker_tripped`/`breaker_deviation_ratio` in `adopt_breaker_metrics`. The two
/// *counters* `feed_ticks` and `feed_rejected` undercount by whatever landed in that
/// window, which is the first tick at startup and one lane's dial time on a reload. They
/// are read through `rate()` and no rule thresholds them, so the alternative (replaying
/// counts nobody recorded) would buy nothing and could only be wrong. `breaker_trips` does
/// not undercount: a trip in that window is the transition itself, recorded once by the
/// seed or by `pair::adopt`'s re-check after the switch.
