//! `deviation`: the built-in market guard, the circuit breaker as it always was minus the
//! latch, which is the lane's now (`guard::Latch`).
//!
//! A jump detector, tick to tick: quoting stops the moment one observed mid jumps further
//! than the configured fraction from the one before it. It is not a bound on where the
//! price may end up (a move that arrives in small steps never trips it, however far it
//! travels, because that is a real market move and `min_mid`/`max_mid` bounds the
//! destination). A second, optional check measures the move over a trailing window of N
//! blocks: at a short window that is still feed integrity, at a long one it is a policy to
//! stop making markets when the market moves this hard. Both trip the same latch.
//!
//! Pure and IO-free on purpose: no clock, no channels, no logging. The composite acts on
//! the verdicts, which is what makes every transition testable without tokio.
