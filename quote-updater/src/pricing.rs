//! Pricing: how a lane turns the market into the `[delta, mid]` it publishes.
//!
//! A [`Pricer`] is built once per lane configuration and asked for a price on every tick.
//! The core wraps it: before it, the freshness gate (a pair with `symbol`/`sources` is
//! refused `no_sample`/`stale` before any pricer runs); after it, a backstop on its output
//! and the pair's band. So a pricer only ever makes the updater more cautious: it can
//! withdraw a quote, never publish one the core would refuse.
//!
//! Everything a pricer sees is exact and in lane orientation, with helpers for the f64
//! world: [`Market::mid_f64`] reads the market the way a person says it (USDC per WETH,
//! whichever way the lane carries it), and [`Market::scaled_fraction`], [`Market::shift`]
//! and [`TickCtx::mid_from_f64`] turn f64 results back into the exact values the lane
//! publishes, inversion and scaling handled.
