//! The places a pair's mid can be read from, and how each one is reached.
//!
//! Every venue delivers the same thing to the rest of the pusher: a price for one market,
//! turned into a [`crate::feed::PriceSample`] by the shared loop in `feed.rs`. What differs
//! per venue is only the wire: where to connect, what to send to be told about a market,
//! what an inbound frame looks like, and how the connection is kept alive. That is all a
//! venue module contains (see `venues/`), so adding one is a URL, a subscribe message and
//! a parser, and the reconnecting, the scaling, the averaging and the metrics come for
//! free.
//!
//! Dispatched through an enum rather than a trait object: a venue's connection step can
//! need an HTTP round trip before the socket is dialled (KuCoin hands out its URL that
//! way), and an `async fn` on an enum is the plain way to have that without boxing.
