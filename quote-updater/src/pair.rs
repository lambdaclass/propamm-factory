/// runs from the moment `build_live` dials it — that is what `build_live` waits for — and
/// the breaker judges every sample the feed reads, including the ones that arrive before
/// this generation owns the pair's series. On a reload that window is every other lane's
/// withdraw.

/// So a pair can arrive here already tripped, and writing a flat 0 over that is not a stale
/// number: the quote loop reads the same latch on its first block and halts on it, leaving a
/// lane that is halted with `breaker_tripped` reading 0. `PusherBreakerTripped` is a *page*
/// on that gauge, and it would never fire. Nothing downstream corrects it: the latch's own
/// write was gated off when it tripped, and the composite judges a tripped lane no further,
/// so no later sample records it either.
///
/// The trip counter moves with the gauge: this is the transition being recorded at the
/// first moment anything is allowed to record it, and recorded once. `Latch::record_trip`
/// claims it, so the latch's own write, if it runs after this read, does not count it
/// again; and a trip landing after this read, before the switch, is recorded by the

    // - `signer_runway_updates` is set only from inside `drive`'s main loop, on the
    //   RUNWAY_CHECK_BLOCKS cadence. If `drive`'s first `get_block_by_number` keeps
    //   failing, it retries internally forever and never reaches that check. No alert rule
    //   compares this gauge any more — `PusherSignerNearlyDry` moved onto the balance below
    //   — but the "Runway" panel still draws it, and a registered 0 there reads as a key
    //   with nothing left. +Inf is "never recorded", rendered as ∞.
    // - `feed_up`/`feed_last_tick`/`feed_sample_current` are set only inside
    //   `composite::spawn`, which a `Static`-source pair never spawns (see the match
    //   below) — a supported configuration (see config.example.toml), not an edge case.
    //   Left at 0 they would permanently fire `PusherFeedDown`, `PusherFeedStale` and
    //   `PusherFeedSampleNotCurrent` on a pair that is working exactly as configured. NaN
    //   fails every comparison those rules make, including `time() - NaN > 30`.
    // - `signer_balance_wei` rides with the runway: same recording site, same cadence, same
    //   never-recorded-until-then. NaN, and it now carries the weight the runway's +Inf used
    //   to: `PusherSignerNearlyDry` is a `predict_linear` over this series, and one NaN
    //   sample anywhere in its window makes the whole range return nothing, so a pair
    //   stalled on an RPC outage cannot page an operator to top up a key that is fine. It
    //   also keeps the "Signer balance" panel honest, where a registered 0 reads as an empty
    //   key and NaN draws a gap. The pair goes NaN together for the same reason
    //   `runway_check` writes them together: a balance with no runway beside it invites
    //   exactly the arithmetic an operator should not be doing by hand.
    //
    // Written by `Service::adopt` rather than here, and that is the second half of the
    // reason this function touches no metrics at all: a reload dials the replacement feed
    // before stopping the pair it replaces, so at this point the gauges below still belong
    // to a lane that is quoting to takers. Writing them here would reach across into that
    // lane's series — and if this build then failed, the reload would leave the numbers
    // there, on a pair it had just promised to leave completely alone.
    // The guards go to whichever arm connects the composite. A pair that streams nothing
    // connects none, and has no market guard to lose: `Kinds::check` refused the file for
    // one, as `config.rs` refuses a breaker on a fixed mid. The closure takes them by value and so is called once, on one arm: a `Cell` in its place
    // would be held across the arm's await and make the run's future `!Send`, which
