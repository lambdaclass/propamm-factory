//! Builder mode: quote every configured builder with the same signed update.
//!
//! The main loop owns everything decided once per block — the target block, its stamp,
//! the pending nonce, and signing the transaction — and publishes the result as an
//! immutable `Arc<Quote>`. One task per builder reads that channel and owns only wire
//! state: its connection, uuid, sequence number, redial timer and requote ticker. The
//! chain head it rolls over on comes from a channel too, fed by one process-wide watcher
//! (head.rs), so no RPC round-trip sits between a price move and its signature.
//!
//! The split is not stylistic. A builder's socket is where its backpressure lives: a
//! write blocks when its buffers are full, and its responses — read between sends and
//! matched to the update they answer — are what bound how much it is sent (MAX_UNACKED)
//! and how long it may stay silent (ACK_TIMEOUT, 5s), while builders evict a quote left
//! idle past ~400ms. In one shared loop a builder that is TCP-alive but slow would cost
//! *every* builder its quote; per-task, it costs only its own.
