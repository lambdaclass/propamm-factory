# The pieces

## The contracts

`PropAMMFactory` creates PropAMM instances. One call does it:

```solidity
createPropAMM(owner, oracle, updaters, pairs)
```

`owner` manages the instance afterwards, `oracle` is the priority update registry it reads
prices from, `updaters` are the addresses allowed to publish prices, and `pairs` is a list of
`(token0, token1, vault)`: the two tokens and the wallet that holds the inventory for that
pair. Each pair can have its own vault.

`PropAMM` is the instance. The owner can add and remove pairs (`addPair`, `setPairVault`),
add and remove updaters (`addUpdater`, `removeUpdater`) and pause it. Traders call `swap`;
anyone can call `quote` and `isActive` to see what a trade would get.

Sources and tests are in [`contracts/`](../contracts/). `make test` runs the tests.

## The quote updater

A Rust program built on the `quote-updater` library. The library does the heavy lifting:
connecting to exchange price feeds, signing the update every block, sending it to the
builders, checking it landed, exposing metrics, reloading the config while running, and
serving the backoffice. What you write is the part that decides the price.

The library ships three pricing models you can use as they are:

- `fixed`: always the same mid and spread. For a stablecoin pair, or to test the wiring.
- `feed`: the exchange mid as it is, with the exchange's spread or one you set.
- `volatile`: a spread that widens when the price is moving and a mid that tilts to rebalance
  your vault. This is what you want for something like WETH/USDC.

You can also write your own. A pricing model is one Rust struct with one method that gets
the market price in and returns a mid and a spread. The smallest complete program is about
30 lines, in [`quote-updater/examples/custom_pricer.rs`](../quote-updater/examples/custom_pricer.rs);
[`example/`](../example/) is a fuller one that reads the vault and adds guards and logging.
[`building-your-own.md`](building-your-own.md) explains how.

Everything else is configuration: a TOML file with your PropAMM's address, your RPC, your
builders, and one block per pair saying which tokens, which exchanges to follow, which
pricing model with which settings, and the name of the environment variable holding that
pair's signing key. `--check` validates all of it against the chain and prints what it would
publish, without sending anything. [`manual.md`](manual.md) is the operating manual.

**The backoffice** is a web page the updater serves. From it you add and remove pairs,
pick the exchanges a pair follows and their weights, change a pair's pricing settings, add
builders, and halt or resume a pair. Every change is written to the config file and applied
without a restart. It has no login, so you put it on a private address (your tailnet).

## Monitoring

The updater exposes Prometheus metrics for everything it does: whether each pair is quoting,
whether updates are landing, the price feeds, the builders, the signer's ETH balance.
[`deploy/alerts/`](../deploy/alerts/) has the alert rules for them. [`deploy/`](../deploy/)
runs Prometheus with those rules, Alertmanager posting them to Slack, Grafana with a
dashboard of the updater, and a Postgres database where the updater records every quote it
published and why, so you can look at it later.
